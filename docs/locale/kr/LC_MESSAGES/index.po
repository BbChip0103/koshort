"Social network services and other internet communities are open and rich data "
"source of human spoken language. But due to the issues of privacy and policy "
"of each website, sharing a bunch of retrieved text data is normally "
"prohibited. To solve the most major Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem "
"under this circumstances, researchers had to rely on limited public datasets "
"and data brought by their company. Otherwise they would implement their domain-"
"specific crawler for each case."
